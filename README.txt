THE TOMOGRAPHER PROJECT
=======================

A toolbox for error analysis in quantum tomography.


Installation
------------

Prerequisites:
    - recent C++ compiler, e.g. g++ >= 4.6
    - CMake >= 2.8.5 http://www.cmake.org/
    - Boost libraries, http://www.boost.org/
    - Eigen3 library, >= 3.2, http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/
    - MatIO library, https://sourceforge.net/projects/matio/
    - 

A recent C++ compiler is required as some C++11 features and elements of its
standard library are used. Also, make sure it supports OpenMP parallelization or
you won't benefit from parallel tasks.

Successful setup:
    - g++ 4.6.3
    - Boost 1.48
    - Eigen 3.2.1
    - MatIO 1.5.2
