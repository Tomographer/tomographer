- Tomographer::MHRWTasks::ValueHistogramTasks -> ValueHistogramTools
  & revised the API a lot -- much more flexible

- mhrwtasks reworked for added flexibiliy (setupRandomWalkAndRun etc., can add controllers
  & refer to each other etc.)

- mhrwcontrollers (incl. step size adjustment & bin error bars convergence control)

- UniformBinsHistogram -> Histogram etc.
  * new Py histogram classes with NumPy buffers
  * deprectated Averaged**Histogram classes

- updated documentation, in particular for writing your own C++ code with a Python module
  interface

- aggregatedhistogram classes

- some api clean-ups

- (python) added compiler info in `tomographer.version.compile_info`

- (C++ & python): MHRWParams now has as first argument an abstract object, MHWalkerParams
  [in python, this is a dictionary of parameters of the random walk]

- reworked the status-report api & helper classes

- PeriodicStatusReportMHRWStatsCollector & Query?StatusReportMHRWStatsCollector

- added minimal examples (minimal_tomorun_controlled.cxx & minimal_single_random_walk)

- tomorun: seed via device random, controllers

- tomorun: new structure for figures of merit, easily extendible
